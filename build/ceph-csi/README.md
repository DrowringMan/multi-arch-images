# Ceph CSI

Note that this image is _not_ built here, but is the result of merging the official images from the CephCSI Quay repository under one manifest and pushing to Docker Hub. The Ceph CSI has many dependencies which makes it difficult to build from scratch in order to support `armhf`. PRs are welcome to change this, of course!
