# Golang - Armv7l

To compile the latest version of the Golang binary you will need version 1.4.3 to compile later versions.

The script will compile for the architecture of the server you execute the script using. Thus if you wish to compile Golang for a armv7l architcture it must run on a machine with that specific architecture. This is true for any desired architecture type.

Once completed you will have a tarball of the compiled binary for your desired architecture, you may either run this script on each individual machine or publish the tarball for later use.

Note: For the purposes of this project it will be published and be publicly available.
